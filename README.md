Woke up at 6. Worked a little. Went to my dad's office cus I had eye appointment and doesn't want to pick me up from home. NGL, I was kinda expecting to be bummed, but it was kinda a blast. His office was lit. Reminded me of my brother's intuit office. The lunch and breakfast there was great and the entire cubicles were empty, cus most employees are hybrid or online now. My dad is hybrid, but he likes to work physically at office because productivity. And then my dad complains when I go to the library, cuz I am more productive and he gets mad. Double standards smh. I was hella productive today :DDD. Eye appointment. Eyes got a tiny bit weaker. Found good frame. Buying it after December 1st. After dad's office, went home and chilled for 30 minutes before I had to go to work for 4 hours. Work was kinda fun today. Went back home. And chilled from 7-9 (rn). Now time to do more work.
